<h2>Overview</h2> 

Have you ever struggled to sample the color of a picture or app on windows? Then project Color Picker Alpha is the solution for you! This app allows you to pick the color anywhere on your screen. By clicking anywhere on the screen, the color at that point is immediately copied to clipboard. When in RGB mode, the color is displayed and copied to clip board in RGB. By selecting the toggle button, the view and clipboard switches to HEX. Our team has also added the abiltiy to create a color history pallete by simply saving the colors you have selected. Then by selecting the color on the pallete your color is immediately copied back onto your clipboard.
